Library Management System
The “LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is an visual studio application. It was created to assist librarians. 
The system would provide basic set of features to add/update books and members to the library. 

The proposed system maintains all the activities involved in library management without putting effort. 
All the records can be viewed from the tables using data grid view control. 

The reports generated are books list, students list, book issue/ returns and reservation details. 
The Related information can be entered and retrieved from the database when required. 
Faster search, precise calculation and better management are some of the key features.

Through robust security features it can be made sure that only the admin can access the information and no others can access it. 
With the enhanced technologies data can be easily accessed and report can be created as per the choice and data can be easily printed and used when required.


Stay tuned for more updates!!!
